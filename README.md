# subsetg-book
A detailed description of PL/I Subset G for programmers

This book consists of two sections.  The "intro" section
is an informal introduction to the PL/I language,
specifically Subset G, otherwise known as ANSI X3.74-1987.
The "dict" section is a dictionary of the PL/I statements,
attributes, conditions, and built-in functions defined in Subset G.

The audience for this book is someone who knows a statically typed
imperative programming language such as C, C++, or Java.
No prior knowledge of PL/I is assumed.
